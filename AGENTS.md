# Repository agent instructions

## Product changelog

Every agent turn that changes user-visible behavior must update `CHANGELOG.md` before delivery.

- Add or refine the entry for the current local date.
- Keep Chinese and English sections semantically mirrored.
- Record only important user-visible additions, improvements, and fixes.
- Merge overlapping bullets from the same day instead of appending implementation details.
- Do not mention exploration, commands, filenames, internal refactors, or intermediate failures.
- Run `node scripts/changelog-maintain.mjs` after editing and `node scripts/changelog-maintain.mjs --check` before delivery.

Visual and interaction work must follow `NavoPathStyle.md`.

## CSS architecture

- Every component owns one canonical style surface; shared UI and behavior must
  reuse the existing primitives and `TaskBlock` variants.
- Do not add historical override layers or duplicate compatibility DOM. Prefer
  tokens, shared components, and the canonical application stylesheet.
- Do not add `!important` without a documented, testable reason. Keep the
  normalized application allowlist at 24 declarations or fewer.
- Before deleting CSS, JSX, or event code, confirm there are no static or
  dynamic callsites and record any intentional selector allowlist in the CSS
  architecture check.
- Run `npm run css:check` when changing CSS, components, or style imports.

## Reuse-first UI implementation

- Before adding a component, hook, event wrapper, CSS selector, or icon, search
  the current workspace for an existing implementation and extend that owner
  when the behavior is shared.
- Reuse `TaskBlock`, `ExecutionSharedLayout`, `Button`, `IconButton`, `Modal`,
  and the canonical [`UiIcons`](src/components/UiIcons.tsx) registry. Do not
  add a second inline SVG for an icon already present in the registry.
- Shared icons must keep their accessible label on the owning button; the icon
  itself remains decorative unless it is the labeled control.
- Delete a duplicate implementation in the same change after checking static
  and dynamic callsites. Do not preserve parallel aliases or compatibility DOM
  without a documented migration reason.
- Keep shared behavior and visual rules in their owning component. Page-level
  code may compose shared primitives, but it must not redefine their base
  geometry, icon drawing, or interaction states.

## Verification policy

Use proportional verification so small changes stay fast without weakening the
release gate.

- During implementation, run only the tests and checks related to the changed
  area. Prefer targeted unit tests, TypeScript checks, and a focused browser flow
  over the complete test suite.
- For small visual or interaction fixes, verify the affected viewport and user
  flow in a real browser. Do not run `npm test` locally by default.
- Run `npm test` locally only when the change affects persistence, migrations,
  synchronization, authentication, security, Electron IPC or updates,
  cross-cutting core logic, dependencies or build tooling, or when the user asks
  for a full local test run.
- GitHub Actions remains the authoritative full-suite gate after every push.
  Follow the workflow to completion and report any failure.
- Run `npm run size:check` locally only when JavaScript or CSS bundle output could
  materially change. The deployment workflow still enforces the size limits.
- Product-code changes must pass `npm run build` before publishing. Documentation-
  only and agent-instruction-only changes may skip the product build.

## Protected product contracts

- `NavoPathStyle.md` is the visual source of truth. Do not replace its palette,
  theme-variable rules, or editorial interaction language with generic defaults.
- The application icon must keep a transparent outer canvas, a white front-facing
  `N`, and black extrusion/shadow. Never ship a white/colored background or a black
  front face. Keep `public/navopath-icon.png`, `build/icon.ico`, and the editable
  source in sync, and verify alpha transparency before publishing.
- Desktop releases must include `latest.yml`, `NavoPath-Setup.exe`, its `.blockmap`,
  and `NavoPath-Portable.exe` under a real semver tag. Do not publish updater assets
  to an `untagged-*` URL, overwrite an existing version, or change the GitHub
  provider in `package.json`.
- The in-app `View release notes` action must continue to open the product changelog
  route (`/changelog`) rather than a transient GitHub asset or draft-release URL.
- Any user-visible change requires mirrored Chinese and English `CHANGELOG.md`
  entries and a version bump before a desktop release.

## End-of-turn GitHub publish

After every conversation that changes files in this repository, finish the turn by publishing the completed work to GitHub:

1. Apply the verification policy above. For product-code changes, run
   `npm run build` and stop the publish flow if it fails.
2. Run `git status` and inspect the diff so the commit scope is understood.
3. Stage the completed work with `git add .` only after confirming all current changes belong to the conversation.
4. Commit with a concise, descriptive message derived from the completed work; never use a placeholder such as `xxx`.
5. Push the current branch with `git push` (or `git push -u origin <branch>` when it has no upstream).

Do not create empty commits when the worktree is clean. Never hide build, commit, or push failures; report them before delivery. Do not stage unrelated user changes silently.
